# Super-Goods
 Super-Good – V.001.

 Welcome to the Super~Goods Are.na Template.
 
 There are still issues with this build, but it is launch-ready with most elements of the site working correctly. Updates will be launched over the next few months to make this more production-ready and a viable template for easy use and installation. The current template is aimed at static-site build and shared hosting. There are lots of things that I want to update with this project so keep an eye out for major changes.

[ ] Better and more dynamic meta tags.
[ ] Cleaner structure and better implementation of components.
[ ] Documentation for all Are.na parameters.
[ ] Better filtering for API parameters.
[ ] Implement channel capability for deeper calls.
[ ] Design modifications.
[ ] More...
